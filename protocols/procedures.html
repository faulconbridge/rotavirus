</ul>
<p>In a water bath, warm PBS, Trypsin, and complete Medium 199 to <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C. Transfer all materials into the biosafety cabinet. Tilt the flask with your cells (having formed a confluent monolayer) such that the culture medium runs towards the neck of the flask. Vacuum out all culture medium using a small glass (Pasteur) pipet connected to the rubber vacuum hose. Dispose of the pipet. To the cell culture, add 10mL <span class="math">\(1\times\)</span> PBS. Tilt the flask to ensure that all cells are thoroughly covered by PBS. Aspirate using a small glass pipet. Dispose of the pipet.</p>
<p>To the cell culture, add <span class="math">\(5\)</span>mL Trypsin, tilting the flask forward and back to ensure that the cells are fully bathed. Vacuum out the Trypsin with a small glass pipet. Add a second <span class="math">\(5\)</span>mL portion of Trypsin to the cell culture. Incubate at <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C until all cells have detached from the surface and are free-floating. (The solution in the flask will turn cloudy as cells detach. Detachment may be verified through the microscope.) Lightly tap the flask with your hand if any cells remain attached.</p>
<p>To the cell culture add <span class="math">\(15\)</span>mL complete Medium 199. (If you used less trypsin in the previous step, adjust the amount of Medium 199 applied such that there is <span class="math">\(20\)</span>mL solution in the flask.)</p>
<p>To each new flask that you wish to prepare, add complete Medium 199 such that the final flask volume after the cell mixture is added will be equal to <span class="math">\(25\)</span>mL. To determine the volume of cell mixture to add to each new flask, we use Table 1.1.</p>

<p>In a water bath, warm PBS, Trypsin, and complete Medium 199 to <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C. Aspirate the cell culture medium from the flask. Wash the cell monolayer in <span class="math">\(10\)</span>mL <span class="math">\(1\times\)</span> PBS and aspirate from the flask.

<p>In a large Eppie tube combine <span class="math">\(400\mu\)</span>L rotavirus SA11 stock and <span class="math">\(2\mu\)</span>L trypsin.

To each of 8 <span class="math">\(14\)</span>mL plastic tubes add <span class="math">\(2.7\)</span>mL serum-free Medium 199.</p>
<p>Add <span class="math">\(300\mu\)</span>L virus mix to the first tube and label as <span class="math">\(10^{-1}\)</span>. Mix the solution by vertex to homogenize. Take <span class="math">\(300\mu\)</span>L of the <span class="math">\(10^{-1}\)</span> solution and add to the second tube. Label <span class="math">\(10^{-2}\)</span>, cap, and mix by vertex.

(Quantities may be increased proportionately if more than 2 plates are being infected at once.)</p>
<p>Wash each plate twice with serum-free Medium 199 by dumping. (See detailed procedure below.) To each plate add the rotavirus titers. Each titer is to be performed in duplicate.

<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Detailed Procedure to Avoid Cell Dessication</p>
<p>During the washing and infection steps, cells may dry out and die. To avoid this, we typically:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Prepare in a glass Pyrex bowl a small amount (<span class="math">\(0.5\)</span>cm deep) of bleach</li>
<li>Prepare one <span class="math">\(50\)</span>mL tube of serum-free M199</li>
<li>For one plate, flip upside down to dump cell culture medium into the bleach solution</li>
<li>Quickly pour into each well <span class="math">\(\sim 3\)</span>mL of serum-free M199 from the prepared vial (pour along the bottom edge of each well to make as little direct contact with the monolayer as possible while pouring)</li>
<li>Tilt the plate to gently wash the cells with the solution</li>
<li>Dump the culture medium into the bleach solution</li>
<li>Again pour into each well <span class="math">\(\sim 3\)</span>mL of serum-free M199 from the prepared vial and spread evenly</li>
<li>Uncap the 3 vials of viral titer that are to be used for the plate</li>
<li>Dump the culture medium into the bleach solution</li>
<li>Quickly pour <span class="math">\(\sim 1\)</span>mL of viral solution into each corresponding well</li>
<li>Label the plate cover with the titers used in each well and set the plate aside</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps sequentially for all remaining plates needing infection (a new tube of serum-free M199 should be used for each plate; the bleach solution may be reused across all plates)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, it is important to both work quickly to ensure that cells do not dry out, but also carefully so that you do not pour M199 or viral inoculant into the wells too heavily, causing cells to wash away. If your plaque assays have sickle-shaped holes, this is likely due to cells having been washed away by heavy pouring. Likewise, large, irregular, blotchy holes are likely caused by cell drying. Generally, if you work too quickly, the halo of washed-away cells will appear; too slowly and the cells will dry out. If you&#8217;re having trouble finding a happy medium, err towards the sickles. These do not <em>necessarily</em> ruin a plaque assay whereas cell desiccation will generally render the entire assay unusable.</p>
</div>
<p>Incubate the plates at <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Liquify a jar of <span class="math">\(1.2\)</span>% agarose using a microwave. Equilibrate the agarose to no more than <span class="math">\(55^{\circ}\)</span>C (hotter and the cells will be killed) and no cooler than <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C (the agarose will resolidify). Warm <span class="math">\(2\times\)</span> EMEM to <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C in a water bath. For each plate infected, prepare a solution of <span class="math">\(10\)</span>mL agarose, <span class="math">\(10\)</span>mL <span class="math">\(2\times\)</span> EMEM, and <span class="math">\(5\mu\)</span>L trypsin. (Add the EMEM first, followed by the trypsin, followed by the agarose. Do not add trypsin to hot agarose.)</p>
<p>One plate at a time, aspirate the viral inoculant. (You may use a new pipet for each well or may use one pipet per plate, aspirating from the lowest concentration well to highest. Tilt the plates downward towards you and keep the pipet along the lower edge of the well. Do not make contact between the pipet and the monolayer.) Quickly add to each well <span class="math">\(\sim 3\)</span>mL of the agarose solution. Place the lid on the well and allow it to sit, undisturbed, for approximately 30 to 45 minutes (until the agarose overlay has solidified). Incubate approximately 3 days at <span class="math">\(37^{\circ}\)</span>C.</p>

<li>Trypan blue</li>
<li><span class="math">\(1\times\)</span> PBS</li>
</ul>
<p>Select one well to use for a cell count. Aspirate the cell culture medium from this well. Add <span class="math">\(1\)</span>mL PBS, spread evenly, and aspirate. Add <span class="math">\(500\mu\)</span>L <span class="math">\(0.05\)</span>% trypsin, spread evenly, and aspirate. Add <span class="math">\(500\mu\)</span>L <span class="math">\(0.05\)</span>% trypsin, spread evenly, and incubate the plate at <span class="math">\(37{^\circ}\)</span>C until all cells have detached from the well.</p>
<p>To the well add <span class="math">\(1.5\)</span>mL complete M199 and mix well. Take <span class="math">\(10\mu\)</span>L cell mix and combine with <span class="math">\(10\mu\)</span>L trypan blue. Apply this mixture to a slide and determine the number of cells per mL. Normalize this to the number of cells per well. (I.e., double the cell count per mL for the <span class="math">\(2\)</span>mL cell solution in the target well.)</p>
<p>Calculate the dilution factor for the SA11 stock by:</p>

<p>Freeze transduced cells completely at <span class="math">\(-80^{\circ}\)</span>C for approximately 30 minutes.  (Depending on the number of plates, the exact time will vary. What is important is that all wells freeze completely.) Remove from freezer and allow to thaw. Refreeze cells overnight in <span class="math">\(-20^{\circ}\)</span>C freezer.</p>
<p>The following day, remove cells from the freezer and allow to thaw fully. Pipet the contents of each well into its own <span class="math">\(15\)</span>mL tube, cap tightly, and label. Use a new pipet for each solution transfer. Centrifuge the solutions at <span class="math">\(500\times\)</span>g for 10 minutes at <span class="math">\(4^{\circ}\)</span>C.</p>
<p>Collect the supernatant from each centrifuged solution in its own fresh tube. Cap, label, and store at <span class="math">\(-20^{\circ}\)</span>C until you are ready to activate the viral content and infect plated cells. The solutions may be stored at <span class="math">\(-80^{\circ}\)</span>C if no cells will be infected immediately.</p>
