Recording Work and Labeling Materials
-------------------------------------

All solutions should be labeled with your name, the date of preparation, and what the solution contains. All cell flasks, plated cells, etc. should be labeled with your name, the date of preparation, the type of cell contained, the passage of cell contained, and, if applicable, any agents with which the cell has been
transduced or infected. All work completed in the lab should be recorded in a laboratory notebook. Each page should contain entries from only a single day if handwritten. The date of entry should be recorded at the top of each page. All writing must be easily readable and written in pen. Any errors should be struck through with a single
solid line with the correction appearing next to it. Any space on a page not used at the end of a work day should be clearly crossed out in pen.

If an electronic lab notebook is used, the same general guidelines apply; however, multiple entries may appear on a single printed page. There must additionally be maintained an audit log of all changes and alterations made to the notebook to which the author has read-only access (i.e., the author must be unable to tamper with the audit log).
